# COMP3608: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Advanced)

*Taken in 2024 Semester 1*

A decent unit to get a foundational understanding of artifical intelligence. You will not leave this unit an expert in deep learning or neural networks, but you will leave having the required perspectives, problem solving, and prerequisite knowledge to then go on and learn those more complex topics.

Assignment 1: Program the Connect 4 game using the minimax search algorithm, with and without alpha-beta pruning. We scored 9/12 for this.

Assignment 2: Implement Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers from scratch and run 10-fold cross-validation using them. Scored 12/12 for code and 10.5/12 for the report.

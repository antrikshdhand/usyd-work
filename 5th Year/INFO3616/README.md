# INFO3616: Principles of Security and Security Eng

*Taken in 2025 Semester 2*

Genuinely one of the most fun and interesting units I have taken in this degree. It has the perfect mix of theory and practical applications, and the lecturer is both great at lecturing and administering the unit.

Assignment 1: 9.7/10
Assignment 2: 9.8/10
Assignment 3: 9.7/10

I have also uploaded all my notes for the unit to help any future student with their study.

# USYD Coursework

The following repository holds any projects or assignments from my coursework at USYD which I think are worthy of sharing with future students. 

Degree: Bachelor of Software Engineering/Bachelor of Science (Mathematical Sciences) (Data Science)

## Progression
I am leaving my degree progression here as to hopefully help a future student out. Please note that I originally started out doing a Bachelor of Aeronautical Engineering and Bachelor of Science (Physics) before changing to my current degree.

A subject in **bold** means I have some coursework from that unit uploaded or linked in this repository.
